# Introduction to SQL

### General Setup

If individuals don't want to use the mozilla firefox extension then we first need to check if the have SQLite installed.  
This can be done by typing in `which sqlite3` into the terminal.  If none comes up and then install instructions can be found
[here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm).

To load the data set use the command:  
`attach "UMichiganWorkStuff/Teaching_Courses/sql_dc_lesson/portal_mammals.sqlite" as db1;`

To quit use command  
`.quit`
